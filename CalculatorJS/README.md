Calculator Application
=========

This is a calculator application built in JavaScript just to pratice JS patterns. I was also writing comments in YuiDoc format
and the folder doc contains all documentation about this application, generated by YuiDoc Node.js extension.
I used some code from this book: JavaScript Patterns by Stoyan Stefanov. Something like, namespace function and code snippet to 
create immutable constants in JS. Also the whole Application.js file is structured like  proper JS application using
the important namspace/module pattern from the book. 

The application doesn't work as it doesn't have GUI, so if you want to learn, open Application.js. You can also open index.html in Firefox inspect the app structure using FIrebug. 
You can create immutable constants with the contructor "new Constants()" in APPLICATION object by calling "set()" function. 

This is in alpha version. It might change in future or I could add proper calculator functionality.
