Calculator Application
=========

This is a calculator application built in JavaScript just to pratice JS patterns. I was also writing comments in YuiDoc format
and the folder doc contains all documentation about this application, generated by YuiDoc Node.js extension.
I used some code from this book: JavaScript Patterns by Stoyan Stefanov. Something like, namespace function and code snippet to 
create immutable constants in JS. Also the whole calc.js file is structured like  proper JS application using
the important namespace/module pattern from the book. 

The application works with all the features but it may still contain bugs or unfinished parts. I am planning to write automated JavaScript tests 
in Jasmine.js or Prototype.js. 
I removed history feature as it will take lot of time to develop. Probably in some of the nex releases. 

Go ahead and test it for me if possible.

Thanks, Vlado.
