AppStructure Application
=========

This is a mockup file and is made to help in structuring your new JavaScript application. 

Several patterns JS are used, Module, Namespace, immediate functions, returning objects, using subobjects, 
using capitalized letters for functions/variables as "Constants", function scope and making accessor methods, 
JS constructors, using Yuidoc and Jasmine for better code quality.

Some of the code is used from this book: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596806767.do "JavaScript Patterns" by Stoyan Stefanov.
If want to know more how all the code works better read this book.

Thanks, Vlado.
