make console app
use any programming language with standard input stream.

format:
$CLASS {
    $VARIABLE $VALUE
}

app should ask for: $CLASS, $VARIABLE, $VALUE
with given variables, it should [change/create new] for each given $CLASS

general flow:
    - get user input
    - read from disk the given file(slate.nk)
    - perform operation [replace/add]
    - write the new file to disk.

example:
read from disk:
starting:
...
    Merge2 {
        name Merge4
    }

    Merge2 {
        operation copy
        name Merge3
    }
...

input: $CLASS=Merge2, $VARIABLE=operation, $VALUE=over

output to disk:
...
    Merge2 {
        name Merge4
        operation over
    }

    Merge2 {
        operation over
        name Merge3
    }
...

the above example 
adds "operation over", to "Merge4"                      // was nonexistent
changes "operation" from "copy" to "over in "Merge3"    // changes operation to new $VALUE
