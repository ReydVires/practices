D3.JS Exercises
===============

I started learning D3.js library and found that lot of the examples are written with kind of bad JavaScript. And of course part of them still use D3 version 3, but there is version 4, so maybe I will find the time to rework the version 3 examples into version 4. But I will rework all with proper JavaScript which passes the JSLint test at least 95% of the code. It could be quite an exercise.
