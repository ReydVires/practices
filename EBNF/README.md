# EBNF research filesI did lot of research on the field of EBNF and how to write proper EBNF code to express context free grammar. EBNF is a set of rules that enable expressing grammars for programming languages i.e, all of programming languages can be expressed as EBNF. EBNF stands for Extended Bacus Naur Form, and it is used when writing compilers. Its ISO standard is number 14977 and I also added the file whichexplaing this standard.[ISO 14977 - EBNF](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-14977.pdf)[EBNF Lecture with exercises](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/ICS-33/lectures/ebnf.pdf)[EBNF](http://matt.might.net/articles/grammars-bnf-ebnf/)I also spent some time with Notepad++ and tried to create my own syntax higlighter for EBNF. The one I have does the job, but not completely.More research is required. ![EBNF-NPP- highlighter](https://github.com/bluePlayer/practices/blob/master/EBNF/images/EBNF-NPP-Highlighter.png "EBNF NPP highlighter")![EBNF common rules](https://github.com/bluePlayer/practices/blob/master/EBNF/images/EBNF-Common-Rules.png "EBNF common rules")![EBNF Symbols 1](https://github.com/bluePlayer/practices/blob/master/EBNF/images/EBNF-Symbols.png "EBNF Symbols Part 1")![EBNF Symbols 2](https://github.com/bluePlayer/practices/blob/master/EBNF/images/EBNF-Symbols2.png "EBNF Symbols Part 2")![EBNF Recursion](https://github.com/bluePlayer/practices/blob/master/EBNF/images/EBNF-Chomsky-hierachy.png "EBNF Recursion")
