# jQuery EBNF Grammar

* An experiment whether an EBNF notation can be used to describe a software tool like jQuery, and therefore read the tool's documentation, therefore learn the tool without reading a 500 pages book.

* Turns out, writing EBNF for a software tool is like writing a subset of a more general EBNF form of a programming language. In this case jQuery is a subset of JavaScript in a sandboxed environment called Web Browser with its W3C/DOM API.

* Yes writing EBNF for a software tool helps learning the structure of the tool and gives overall acquaintance. 
I also think it might help learning a tool which is very new and has no book or tutorial coverage.
